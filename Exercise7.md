# **Exercise 7: VMware App Volumes**

## **Exercise 7.1: Importing VMs from Microsoft Azure Marketplace**

In this exercise, you import a VM from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, configure it with applications, and convert the VM to an image. With this image, you can then create new instances of the VM.

Later in this Tutorial, a set of exercises create an RDS server farm, for which you need an image with a server OS. Another set of exercises create a pool of VDI desktops, for which you need a Windows 10 desktop OS.

This exercise demonstrates deploying a new image using a desktop OS, and the process for deploying a server OS is virtually the same.

### **Task 1: Navigate to Imported VMs**

1. In the navigation panel of the Horizon Cloud Service Administration Console, click **Inventory**.

2. In the Inventory menu, click **Imported VMs**.

3. In Imported VMs page, click on **IMPORT** button.
